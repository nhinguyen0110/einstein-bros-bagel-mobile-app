# einstein-bros-bagel-mobile-app

This is the project of group 8 in our System Analysis and Design class. The general issue to research initially is to understand the specific needs and preferences of customers when it comes to ordering food and drinks from Einstein's Bagels via a mobile app. This research will help in designing an efficient and user-friendly mobile ordering platform tailored to the requirements of a service-based business like Einstein's Bagels.
